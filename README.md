# Kanban task managment 
This is my pet project. The idea was taken from the site https://www.frontendmentor.io/

## Site functionality
* Creating new board using the "Create New Board" button in the sidebar. This button opens a board creation modal where you can name the board and add columns. Board can be selected using sidebar panel.
* Editing board using board editing modal that can be opened by button "New column" or "Edit modal" button in the header.
* Board can be deleted using delete button in the kebeab menu in the header.
* Adding task to board by using "Add New Task" button that open task creation modal. Each task belongs to some column and have subtasks.
* Using drag & drop you can move task from one column to another.
* Task modal can be opened by clicking on a task card. In this modal you can mark subtasks completed/uncompleted or change task status.
* Using task modal menu you can open edit task modal where you can change task name, subtasks and status. Also you can delete task.
* Theme can be switched to dark/light using button in the sidebar.
